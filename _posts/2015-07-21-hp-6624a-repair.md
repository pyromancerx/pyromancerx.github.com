So this Ebay number is going to become my bench power supply. Although it is billed as a system supply for a more semi-permanent installation there is no reason it cannot adequately supply my bench top needs. This particular unit has quad output and each one is dual rated. The ratings are 0-7V at 5A and 0-20V at 2A for two outputs and 0-20V at 2A and 0-50V at .8A for the other two outputs. This gives a very nice range and can supply decent amounts of power for small projects on the bench.

As usual UPS is the most destructive carrier I know of. Somehow the very well foam packed unit managed to get thrown around hard enough to destroy the front panel LCD. This makes the unit very hard to use (read impossible).

The interior of the unit suffered no damage and was exceptionally clean for a pieced of used equipment.

The seller on ebay was very understanding of my report of damage and managed to salvage a replacement screen for me.

A couple of the quirks with this repair had to do with some very specific elements of the construction of the unit. The first was that the replacement cable from the seller was far too short and I still needed to replace the end connector. I managed to disassemble the connector on both of the cables and swap out the damaged parts.

The second quirk was the use of pozidrive rather than straight phillips screw heads. This was easily overcome with my on hand bit set but took multiple tries to find the exact fit for the screws.

Overall the unit appears to be fully functional and my next steps are to create some interface jacks/boxes to let me keep the actual unit out of the way but still have access to the output which as on the back of the unit.
